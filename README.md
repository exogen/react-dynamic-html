# react-dynamic-html

Like `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` but with simple old-school template substitution.
Values can be React components.

Because sometimes you just need to work with HTML from an older system or CMS.

- Zero dependencies, no HTML parser necessary
- Template values can be dynamic React components
- Universal, supports server side rendering (SSR)
- Template updates preserve component state
