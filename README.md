# react-dynamic-html

Sometimes you just need to work with HTML from an older system or a CMS.

This does old-school runtime HTML templating, but in React!

- Zero dependencies, no HTML parser necessary!
- Template values can be dynamic React elements!
- Universal, supports server side rendering (SSR)!
- Keeps component state across template changes!
